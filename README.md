# Linux-Terminal-Customization
A simple Linux terminal customization project using Fastfetch, ASCII logos, and a custom Bash script.  The project shows how I personalized my terminal by creating a custom ASCII logo, adding a startup script, and editing the .bashrc file to display system information in a clean and aesthetic way.
